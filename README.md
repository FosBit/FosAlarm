# FosAlarm

> ###### v0.3.0 (beta) (Disclaimer: This project is in a pre-release stage of development. This means that some parts of the app may not function as expected. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!)

Are memorizing things hard for you? Do you have a hard time waking up in the morning? Maybe both? FosAlarm is here! 

FosAlarm is an alarm to help users with the act of memorization. For most things we need to memorize, we need to set aside time in the day/week just commit it to memory. But with a busy schedule, how can we find time? Well, why not make it the first thing you do when you wake up? Just set an alarm with the word/phrase you want to memorize, and FosAlarm will ring when it's time to wake up and prompt you to fill in blanks for what you neet to remember!
